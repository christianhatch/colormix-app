Colormix is a Simple, Clean, and Trustworthy tool that allows you to experience firsthand how the RGB and HSB color spaces interact, and how hexadecimal representations of colors are created.

Simply slide the Hue, Saturation, or Brightness sliders and see what happens to the Red, Green, and Blue sliders and the hex value label. Pretty cool huh? 
Pro Tip: try tapping on the hex label and see what happens :)

Are you curious to find out how the Red/Green/Blue and the Hue/Saturation/Brightness color spaces really work?
