Colormix
========

A simple color mixer that allows you to see firsthand how RGB and HSL color spaces interact.

Colormix is a simple slider-based color picker that I built so that I could better understand how the RGB and HSL color spaces interact.Originally I built this component when I was learning about color spaces; I wanted to see how changing values in one color space changed the other, to better understand what exactly was going on when generating colors from 3 float values. It also helped me to understand how numbers are converted to hex values, because I could watch how the hex value changed as I moved the sliders.
