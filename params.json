Originally I built this component when I was learning about color spaces; I wanted to see how changing values in one color space changed the other, to better understand what exactly was going on when generating colors from 3 float values. It also helped me to understand how numbers are converted to hex values, because I could watch how the hex value changed as I moved the sliders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**MIT License (MIT)**\r\n\r\n**Copyright (c) 2014 Christian Hatch**\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
